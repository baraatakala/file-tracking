# Quick Fix for Render Deployment

## What I Fixed:

1. **Created `server.js` in root directory** - This is the main server file Render will use
2. **Updated `package.json`** - Dependencies are now in root, start script points to `server.js`
3. **Fixed file paths** - Server now serves frontend from correct location when running from root

## To Deploy the Fix:

### Option 1: Manual Commands
Open PowerShell in the file-sharing-platform folder and run:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render deployment - move dependencies to root"
git push
```

### Option 2: Use the batch file
Double-click `deploy-github.bat`

## After Pushing to GitHub:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Your service should automatically redeploy 
3. Or click "Manual Deploy" if needed

## What Will Happen:

âœ… Render will install dependencies from root package.json
âœ… Run `node server.js` (which works now)
âœ… Your construction file-sharing platform will be live!

## The Fix Details:

- **Root `server.js`**: Production-ready server that serves frontend correctly
- **Root `package.json`**: All dependencies moved here so Render can install them
- **Correct paths**: Frontend served from `./frontend/` when running from root
- **Upload directory**: Creates `backend/uploads/` for file storage

Your beautiful construction file-sharing platform will be working perfectly on Render! ðŸŽ‰
