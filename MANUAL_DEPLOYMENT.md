# Manual GitHub Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

Since automated scripts may need manual authentication, here are the manual steps to deploy your Construction File Sharing Platform to GitHub:

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
Navigate to your project directory:
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\isc\VS_Code\project_2\project_2\file-sharing-platform"
```

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```cmd
git init
```

### Step 3: Configure Git User
```cmd
git config user.name "baraatakala"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

### Step 4: Add All Files
```cmd
git add .
```

### Step 5: Create Initial Commit
```cmd
git commit -m "Initial commit: Construction File Sharing Platform"
```

### Step 6: Add GitHub Remote
```cmd
git remote add origin https://github.com/baraatakala/file-tracking.git
```

### Step 7: Push to GitHub
```cmd
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: You may need to authenticate with GitHub. Options include:
- Personal Access Token (recommended)
- GitHub CLI authentication
- SSH key authentication

### Step 8: Verify Deployment
After successful push, your project will be available at:
https://github.com/baraatakala/file-tracking
